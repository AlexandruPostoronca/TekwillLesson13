<h2>Books as strings</h2>
<p>Here's a class named <code>Book</code>. It has three fields: string field <code>title</code>, int field <code>yearOfPublishing</code> and an array of strings <code>authors</code>. Override the method <code>toString</code> in the class to return string representations of books.</p><p>The overridden method must return a string including all field-value pairs separated by commas. An array of authors always includes at least one author. Do not add a comma after the last author.</p><p>Here is an example: <strong>"title=Java 8 &amp; 9 in Action,yearOfPublishing=2017,authors=[Mario Fusco,Alan Mycroft]</strong>". Pay attention, the quote marks are not part of the string.</p>
